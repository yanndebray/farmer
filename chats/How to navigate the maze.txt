To navigate the maze shown in the image and reach the treasure, you can implement the following steps. This process essentially follows the right-hand rule for maze-solving, where you follow the wall on your right-hand side.

### Steps to Navigate the Maze

1. **Initialize Directions**: Define your direction array.
   ```python
   directions = [North, East, South, West]
   index = 0  # Assuming the drone starts facing North.
   ```

2. **Check if Move is Possible**: Write a function to attempt a move and update the drone's position.
   ```python
   def try_move(direction):
       success = move(direction)
       return success
   ```

3. **Maze Navigating Strategy**: Follow the wall on your right. If you can't move right, try moving straight, left, or backtrack if necessary.
   ```python
   while True:
       # Rotate right
       index = (index + 1) % 4
       
       # Try to move in the new direction
       if not try_move(directions[index]):
           # If right is blocked, rotate back to the original direction and move straight
           index = (index - 1) % 4
           if not try_move(directions[index]):
               # If straight is blocked, rotate left and move
               index = (index - 1) % 4
               if not try_move(directions[index]):
                   # If left is blocked, rotate left again and move back
                   index = (index - 1) % 4
                   try_move(directions[index])
   
       # Check if we have found the treasure
       if get_entity_type() == Entities.Treasure:
           harvest()
           break  # Exit once the treasure is harvested       
   ```

### Explanation

1. **Direction Array**: The `directions` list holds the possible movements (North, East, South, West). The `index` keeps track of the current direction the drone is facing.
2. **Movement Function (`try_move`)**: This function calls the `move()` function and returns whether the move was successful.
3. **Main Loop**: This loop follows the right-hand rule to navigate the maze:
    - Rotate the drone right and attempt to move.
    - If the right side is blocked, return to your original direction and try to move straight.
    - If straight is blocked, rotate left and attempt to move.
    - If the left side is blocked, rotate left again (now facing the opposite of the original direction) and try to move back.

This strategy ensures that the drone methodically explores the maze and eventually finds the treasure. The loop exits when `get_entity_type()` confirms the drone is over the treasure, at which point `harvest()` is called to collect it.
